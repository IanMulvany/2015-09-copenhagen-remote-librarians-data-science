BUILDING CAPACITY FOR SCIENCE ON THE WEB & HOW LIBRARIANS CAN HELP

Leveraging the web for open science 

- scratch that and replace web with internet, things get a lot more interesting that way. 


# What is the web/internet ?
	- exposes hypermedia resources that are addressable by unique ID
	- you can put almost anything at the end of one of those IDs, and you can start to return all sorts of things 


# Why is it disruptive?
	- the cost of entry can be low (and it can also be very expensive)
	- pushing bits starts out cheap (and only gets expensive when you have probably figured out that it's worth paying for)
	
	
	
# Why do journals even exist any more?

	If the web is so damned disruptive, then why is it that all the journals have not yet disappeared? 

	- they are a manifestation of community 

	- shifting behaviour in a large community requires collective action, and collective action is hard without a force for universal coordination (think about what it might be like to make a country change the side of the road that it drove on! c.f. [Sweden 1967](http://www.wired.com/2014/02/throwback-thursday-sweden/)) 

	- what other manifestations of community exist in the scholarly space? 
		- the department
		- the institution
		- the library 		
			- the library has the capacity to sit across departments, and to play a trans-institutional role too. 



# challenges of the web 
	(are not dissimilar from the challenges on any project)
	- you need to skill up 
		- some of the upscaling can be like a step function, rather than a gradual ramp
			- e.g. learning how to write using the vi\vim text editor 
		- (I can't read this perl program means "I wrote this perl program")
		- finding out if what you did was useful at all can be hard 
		- having too many people with good ideas, and not enough people to actually do the thing to build
			- a solution to this is to align with, or create, a community that wants to see change in the same direction that you want to see change, you trade full autonomy for effectiveness. 



# unique challenges of the web 
	- the web is tone deaf, and horribly public
		- storms can brew quickly in teacups, and people can lose their shit because the distance of type is very low bandwidth, and loses nuance and subtly rapidly 
	- so many people are on working on this platform, that things go really fast, so what you are building today was already outdated somewhere else, 


# opportunities of the web
	- the web runs on code
	- open source code is also a manifestation of community 
		- when you get an active community amazing things can happen (it doesn't have to be open source to be amazing, but there are significant benefits around preservation, and IP that come from open science, and open source projects)
			- wikipedia 
			- kickstarter 
			- atom editor 
			- open malaria 
			- zooniverse 



# some other random thoughts 
	- structure & curation are expensive 
	- their need is based on the fidelity of the questions you are asking of your data
	- machine learning is getting to the point where what we previously thought of as core metadata can now be inferred
		- google photos magic tags / flick magic tags  
			- [there is still room for terrible errors with these systems](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3145887/Google-apologises-Photos-app-tags-black-people-gorillas-Fault-image-recognition-software-mislabelled-picture.html)
			- the model that generates these identifications should now be thought of as a first class citizen however such models are proprietary, and they should be in the public domain, where the model concerns you. 
			
			
			
# core components of what librarians can do
	- training on tools 
	- hosting of data 
	- an approach to curation and registration 
	- an approach to community building 
	- playing a neutral trusted party in the institution 
	- showing researhers tooling
		- give the example from Janelia farm 
	- managing sensitive data 
	- INFRASTRUCUTRE 
		- you now form a part of the infrastructure of knowledge (very loose analgy here to bitcoin, the blockhain a public leger and open access material, probably too weak for this presentation )
	
# changes in internal views that librarians might need to make about themselves 
	- rethink what the core objects are that you are concerned with 
	- think hard about infrastructure 
	- the walls between IT and the librarian needs to get thinner 
	- this is a consequence of sofware eating the world, in what way are you going to take that change and make it work towards your advantage?
